This was a quick & fun one! I was looking for two main things out of this project: try out all the new AI coding tools (hey Cursor), and build myself a link in bio tool that's free and a little bit more tech-focused.

On the first point, I was definitely able to try out a lot of new tools. I won't breakdown this side of the project here, but it was great to scope out both the good and the bad of these tools.

On the actual website I wanted to build, I know, I know, there are already a lot of these tools out there, but none of them are quite as tech-oriented as I would like. The main features I wanted for my tool are:

- All the core professional links (github, linkedin, twitter, etc.) to be easily added and displayed
- A simple and clean design
- The ability to create sublists of books, papers, blogs, projects, etc. It would be nice to be able to easily share a list of books I've read on a topic on my website
- Tech-focused previews (e.g. github heatmap preview)

I'm not entirely done yet, but I'm pretty happy with the way it's coming along (see [arays.me](https://www.arays.me)). Let me know what you think!
