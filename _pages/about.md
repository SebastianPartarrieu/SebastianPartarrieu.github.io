Hey there. I'm a part French, English and Chilean engineering (probably better described as applied mathematics) student at [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), one of France's [top](https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/article/classement-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs_670e7e40-1ff2-11ea-88a9-d2e707b938cd/) institutions for such things. The French higher educational system is full of wonderful, if not distressing, [peculiarities](http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Education.html#ecoles), so don't be too surprised if some elements of my [resume](/assets/pdf/cv_sebastian_partarrieu_eng.pdf) seem weird to you ... 

In any case, I'm interested in a great many topics, the latest being all things related to artificial intelligence (how original!). Following this interest, I'm currently pursuing a research internship within the [Jia Liu Group](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/). My particular work will focus on improving existing methods using coupled autoencoders to integrate various data modalities in order to robustly characterize neuronal cell types. I'll also be working on some mathematical methods to prove the stability of a 'soft' brain computer interface.
