Hey there. I'm a part French and Chilean engineering (probably better described as applied mathematics) student at [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/), one of France's [top](https://etudiant.lefigaro.fr/article/classement-des-ecoles-d-ingenieurs_670e7e40-1ff2-11ea-88a9-d2e707b938cd/) institutions for such things. The French higher educational system is full of wonderful, if not distressing, [peculiarities](http://www.understandfrance.org/France/Education.html#ecoles), so don't be too surprised if some elements of my [resume](/assets/pdf/cv_sebastian_partarrieu.pdf) seem weird to you ... 

In any case, I'm interested in a great many topics, the latest being all things related to artificial intelligence, brain-machine interfaces, computational neuroscience, computational biology, proactive healthcare, wearable technologies, performance optimization, decision-making under uncertainty and the list goes on... Following one of these interests, I've just finished a research internship within the [Jia Liu Group](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) and started a new one within the [Landau lab](https://www.landaulab.org/). I worked, and am working, on loads of cool things I'd be happy to discuss and that you should be able to check out soon on my publications page ;). See ya!
