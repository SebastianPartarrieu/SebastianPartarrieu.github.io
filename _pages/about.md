Hey there! I'm a French and Chilean software engineer currently working for [Joko](https://engineering.joko.com/posts/). Previously, I was a master's student studying Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning in Paris. I pursued a double master's degree between [Mines de Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/). If those names don't sound familiar - go check them out, I promise they're very good schools!

I (try to) write code, read and think a lot. I've worked on decoding/analyzing neural signals from brain-machine interfaces within the [Jia Liu Group](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/), on using machine-learning to predict the presence of cancer through liquid biopsy genetic data at the [Landau lab](https://www.landaulab.org/), and on using large language models to understand web pages automatically at [Joko](https://engineering.joko.com/posts/webpages-and-llms-a-match-made-in-heaven/).

Outside of this, I love: climbing :mountain:, playing tennis :tennis:, skiing :ski:, travelling :earth_americas:, observing the night sky :milky_way:, and enjoying a good party :tada: once in a while.
