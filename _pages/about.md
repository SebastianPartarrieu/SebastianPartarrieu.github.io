Hey there. I'm a French and Chilean master's student studying Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning in Paris. I'm pursuing a double master's degree between [Mines de Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/). If those names don't sound familiar - go check them out, I promise they're very good schools!

I write code, read and think a lot. Currently, I've spent a fair amount of thinking time on artificial intelligence, neuroscience (mostly computational) and personalized medicine in oncology. Following all these interests, I took a year off before the final year of my dual master's: I've just finished back to back research internship within the [Jia Liu Group](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Landau lab](https://www.landaulab.org/) before joining [Owkin](https://owkin.com/).

Outside of this, I love: climbing :mountain:, playing tennis :tennis:, skiing :ski:, travelling :earth_americas:, observing the night sky :milky_way:, being bad at chess :crown: and enjoying a good party once in a while.

Finally, I'm planning on applying to PhDs this Fall. I will be documenting the process, any tips & tricks are welcome!
