Hey there! I'm a French and Chilean master's student studying Applied Mathematics and Machine Learning in Paris. I'm pursuing a double master's degree between [Mines de Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu/) and the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/). If those names don't sound familiar - go check them out, I promise they're very good schools!

I (try to) write code, read and think a lot. Recently, I've spent a fair amount of thinking time on various sub-fields of machine learning, neuroscience & bio-engineering (brain-machine interfaces), personalized medicine in oncology, amongst many other things. Following all these interests, I took a year off before the final year of my dual master's where I carried out back to back research internship within the [Jia Liu Group](https://liulab.seas.harvard.edu/) and the [Landau lab](https://www.landaulab.org/) before joining [Owkin](https://owkin.com/). I'm now doing my end-of-studies internship as a machine-learning research intern at [Joko](https://www.joko.com/en) where I'll be helping to build the world's best all-in-one shopping app and mobile browser: stay tuned!

Outside of this, I love: climbing :mountain:, playing tennis :tennis:, skiing :ski:, travelling :earth_americas:, observing the night sky :milky_way:, and enjoying a good party :tada: once in a while.
