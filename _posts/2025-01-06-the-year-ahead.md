As a child, my favorite bedtime story was _David and Goliath_. I would ask for it every night, and I must have heard it hundreds of times. Yet, it continuously struck a chord with small Sebastian who, as the youngest of 4, felt like the underdog in many situations. David's courage gave me hope, and a deep belief that despite being the youngest and smallest (at the time) of the family, I could still do great things.

Looking back, I realize a lot of my life has been shaped by this desire to prove myself by taking on my own Goliaths. The Philistine champion may have evolved over the years, but there's always been one.

This year, Goliath is twofold: the market and time. As I kick off 2025 by working on my own project (more on that soon), I hope to use my sling and stone effectively, and fight to bring the project to _default-alive_. It'll require action, and lots of it. So here's to a year of action and intentionality! May we all apply it to the important facets of life - health, fitness, relationships, learning and building.
