As a child, my favorite bedtime story was David and Goliath. I would ask for it every night, and I must have heard it hundreds of times. Yet, it continuously struck a chord with small Sebastian who, as the youngest of 4, felt like the underdog in many situations. David's courage gave me hope, and a deep belief that despite being the youngest and smallest (at the time) of the family, I could still do great things. Looking back, I realize a lot of my life has been shaped by this desire to prove myself by beating Goliath. The Philistine champion has certainly morphed over the years, but there's always been one.

This year, Goliath will be the market, and time. As I kick off 2025 by working on my own project (more on that soon), I hope to use my sling and stone with David's courage and ability, and fight to bring the project to default-alive. It'll require action, and lots of it. So here's to a year of action and intentionality! May you apply it to all important facets of life - health, fitness, relationships, learning and building.
